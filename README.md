# Create: Villager Tourism
Villager Tourism is a mod that adds a new use for trains in create - One can place a "Tourism Bureau" block down in a village (there must be 3 or more villagers within a 10 block radius for this to work) and after this point "Tourist" entities will randomly start spawning about the block.

For each unique structure the Tourists are taken through (you can check if your rail goes through a structure by using the camera item) a point will be awarded, with additional points awarded for being transported 1000 and 2000 blocks from there origin village (when measured in a straight line).

Once the Tourist is safely returned to their home village, they will dissapear and add there point total to the Bureau block, A player can interact with the block to see how many points are currently stored and what this Bureau's total points are. The player can then shift-interact with the block to retrieve all the points in the form of emeralds!
